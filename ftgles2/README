Note: This is a special version of a special version FTGL which was ported to OpenGLES by David Petrie and
bugfixed and put together with the original autoconf build system by James Long, the second special on this special is to switch things from 
ftgles to ftgles2, as it uses open gl es 2.0, by Hibbard Engler.

Before Hib got involved, there were Further bug fixes by David Petrie.

===========

FTGL 2.1
5 December 2004

DESCRIPTION:

FTGLES2 is a free open source library to enable developers to use arbitrary
fonts in their OpenGL ES 2.0 (www.opengl.org) applications.

Besiges the font standalone https://github.com/hibengler/HibFonts (not fully setup) which is a vector font,  there 
really isnt much out there for drawing fonts.
Unlike other OpenGL font libraries FTGL used standard font file formats
so doesn't need a preprocessing step to convert the high quality font data
into a lesser quality, proprietary format. FTGLES2 follows in the FTGL footsteps.

FTGLES2 uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode'
the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient
for OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering.

Rendering modes supported are:
- Bit maps
- Antialiased Pix maps
- Outlines
- Polygon meshes
- Extruded polygon meshes
- Texture maps
- Buffer maps

USAGE:

	FTGLPixmapFont font("Arial.ttf");
	font.FaceSize(72);
	font.Render("Hello World!");
